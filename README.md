# Overview

I want to make games in the future, it will probably just be side projects unless it kicks off.

I made a simple snake game, you start out as a sake with 3 segments, head, body, and tail. you move with the arrow keys to grab the fruit and grow your snake. Don't colide with your body or the borders.

I want to get comfortable codin games.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* Powerups
* Snake gets faster the more it eats
* Poops if you're to slow to get the next fruit and the snake shrinks
